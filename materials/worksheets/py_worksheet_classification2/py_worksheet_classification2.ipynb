Products are classified based on appearance, size and shape, attributes which helps determine the quality of the food. Sorting can be done by humans, but it is tedious and time consuming. Automatic sorting could help save time and money. Images of the food products are captured and analysed to determine visual characteristics. \n",

    "K-nearest neighbors is sensitive to the scale of the predictors so we should do some preprocessing to standardize them. Remember that standardizing involves centering/shifting (subtracting the mean of each variable) and scaling (dividing by its standard deviation). Also remember that standardization is *part of your training procedure*, so you can't use your test data to compute the centered / scaled values for each variable. Therefore, you must pass only the training data to your preprocessor to compute the preprocessing steps. This ensures that our test data does not influence any aspect of our model training. Once we have created the standardization preprocessor, we can then later on apply it separately to both the training and test data sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "The vast majority of predictive models in statistics and machine learning have parameters that you have to pick. For the past few exercises, we have had to pick the number of neighbours for the class vote, which we have done arbitraily. But, is it possible to make this selection, *i.e., tune the model, in a principled way?* Ideally, we want to pick the number of neighborurs to maximize the performance of our classifier on data *it hasn’t seen yet*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of the tuning process is that we can, if we want to, split our training data again, train and evaluate a classifier for each split, and then choose the parameter based on all of the different results. If we just split our training data once, our best parameter choice will depend strongly on the randomness from how this single split was made. Using multiple different splits, we’ll get a more robust estimate of accuracy, which will lead to a more suitable choice of the number of neighbours $K$ to perform well on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of training and evaluating models on multiple training data splits times is called \"cross-validation\". In cross-validation, we split our overall training data into $C$ evenly-sized chunks, and then iteratively use 1 chunk as the **validation set** and combine the remaining $C−1$ chunks as the **training set.** The validation set is used in a similar was as the test set, **except** that the test set is only used once at the end to report model performance whether we use model performance on the validation set to select the model during cross-validation. \n",

We should set `return_train_score` to be `True` to return the training score as well.\n",
    "\n",

You can reuse the `X` and `y` variables you constructed from the training data earlier, as well as the `fruit_preprocessor`and `knn_spec` variables. However, you will need to create a new pipeline since the one we made earlier is already fitted on all the data and here we want to fit it on different splits of the data during cross-validation.
